# ObserverPattern
To demonstate Observer Pattern I used crypto currency market example. This market could have a lot of cruptocurrencies and also have a subscribers that want to follow when new crypto is added to list. We can register a new user to  subscribers list, if that user doesn't want to get any news we can remove him from subscribers so he couldn't get any new information. Adding  crypto needs a ID and object of coin: object of coin has a name and price. But if we want to remove this crypto we need just to know its ID. Currencies being saved in hashMap, their ID is a key. Whenever this market gets new crypto or removes one, we call notifier which will notify all subscribed users: it will show what was added or removed then it will show current available cryptos. There are additional check of ID, if this ID is already in list, error will be thrown with proper message.
